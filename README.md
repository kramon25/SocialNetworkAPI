# Social-Network API

## Description

This API serves as the backbone for a social networking web platform, enabling users to post their ideas, respond to their friends' ideas, and manage their list of friends. It utilizes Express.js for handling routes, relies on a MongoDB database coupled with the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, and leverages Moment.js to format timestamps. The initial data population is accomplished through the use of Insomnia.
